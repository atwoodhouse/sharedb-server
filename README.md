# sharedb-server
A simple sharedb server for managing collaborative remote edits of shared JSON documents.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node 14+. I'm personally on Node 18. It's recommended to install Node 18 via [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

The project uses pnpm as its package manager. Install pnpm with:

```bash
npm i -g pnpm
```

## Run

Clone the project.

Install the project.

```bash
pnpm i
```

Start the server.

```bash
pnpm start
